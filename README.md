# DS-Unit-3-Sprint-1
A repository of all work and assignments from Unit 3, Sprint 1.

# Motivation
As I'm working my way through Lambda School, a strong desire to succeed needs to be matched by a well curated Repository and thus, I hope my work here reflects my aspirations.

# Status
Currently it is modified and updated through Module 4. 
This should complete basic requirements, but as my knowledge and skills grow, continued work on the repo should be made and noted here.

# Features
This repo includes, but is not limited to, work completed in class and homework assignments.
This provides insight not just into what I'm learning, but how it's helping me grow my skillset.

# Installation
Everything found within was developed using a Python 3 installation, utilizing pandas and numpy.
Few installations should be necessary to achieve compatibility.

# Credits
A majority of the code, being guided lecture assignments, was written by my instructor, Nick Delafuente
All assignment work was done by myself, Joe Costa

# License
This repo utilizes an MIT license
